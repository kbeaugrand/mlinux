       BUILDING
-------------------------

Note that mLinux should *not* be built as root and you will need full write 
permissions to the build directory structure.  It is recommended to build 
the software inside your $HOME dir as a normal user.

1. Build from tarball

    tar xzf mLinux-3.0.0.tar.gz
    cd mlinux-3.0.0
    # install needed dependencies, see scripts in install-deps
    # example: sudo ./install-deps/install-debian-ubuntu-deps.sh
    source env-oe.sh

    # set your default machine type in conf/local.conf
    # MACHINE="mtcdt"

    # build an image
    bitbake mlinux-base-image

2. Build from git repository

    # clone repo to a dir name of your choice
    git clone git://git.multitech.net/mlinux.git mlinux-3.0.0
    cd mlinux-3.0.0

    # checkout desired branch or tag
    git checkout 3.0.0

    # install needed dependencies, see scripts in install-deps
    # example: sudo ./install-deps/install-debian-ubuntu-deps.sh

    # initialize git submodules and setup dir structure
    ./setup.sh

    # setup environment
    source env-oe.sh

    # set your default machine type in conf/local.conf
    # MACHINE="mtcdt"

    # build an image
    bitbake mlinux-base-image
