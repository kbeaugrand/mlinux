       BUILDING
-------------------------

Note that mLinux should *not* be built as root and you will need full write 
permissions to the build directory structure.  It is recommended to build 
the software inside your $HOME dir as a normal user.

1. Build from tarball

    tar xzf mLinux-3.0.0.tar.gz
    cd mlinux-3.0.0
    # install needed dependencies, see scripts in install-deps
    # Also switch to the build directory.
    # example: sudo ./install-deps/install-debian-ubuntu-deps.sh
    source oe-init-build-env

    # set your default machine type in conf/local.conf
    # MACHINE="mtcdt"

    # build an image
    bitbake mlinux-base-image

2. Build from git repository

    # clone repo to a dir name of your choice
    git clone git://git.multitech.net/mlinux.git mlinux-3.0.0
    cd mlinux-3.0.0

    # checkout desired branch or tag
    git checkout 3.0.0

    # install needed dependencies, see scripts in install-deps
    # example: sudo ./install-deps/install-debian-ubuntu-deps.sh

    # initialize git submodules and setup dir structure
    ./setup.sh
    # setup.sh generates a random mtadm password, and places the
    # password in build/conf/local.conf and password.txt
    #
    # 
    # To specify a password use an environmental variable,
    # MTADM_PASSWORD
    MTADM_PASSWORD="3g_t1zX0" ./setup.sh 
    #
    # To change the password, remove MTADM_PASSWORD and
    # MTADM_PASSWORD_HASH from conf/local.conf and re-run:
    MTADM_PASSWORD="Y5bG3m_2" ./setup.sh

    # setup environment and switch to build directory
    source oe-init-build-env

    # set your default machine type in conf/local.conf
    # MACHINE="mtcdt"

    # build an image (current working directory is
    # build)
    bitbake mlinux-base-image
